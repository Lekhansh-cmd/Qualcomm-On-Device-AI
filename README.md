# Qualcomm-On-Device-AI

AI Used: Qualcomm AI Hub

## Objective
This project by DeepLearning.AI aims to study:
1. On-Device AI
2. Applications of On-Device AI
3. Deploying Segmentations Model On-Device
4. Preparing for On-Device Deployment
5. Quantizing Models

## On-Device AI
On-Device AI is everywhere and finds its application in real-life scenarios such as 
1. Drones, Robots, Mobile Phones, IoTs
2. Image and Video: Photo Classification, QR Code Detection
3. Audio and Speech: Text to Speech, Noise Removal, Speech Recognition

## Pros of On-Device AI
1. Cost Effective
2. Efficient: Faster Processing Speed
3. Privacy: Keeps data on the device
4. Personalization: Continuous Model Personalization On-Device

## Step 1: Deploying Segmentation Models On-Device
For our project, we are using FFNet 40s, which is a segmentation model with high performance and is extremely configurable. It has a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
ResNet-like backbone and small multi-scale head.
